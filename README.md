# Local Weather App

## Testing Locally
1. Install the npm http-server module with `$ npm install http-server -g`
1. Clone this repo to your machine.
1. cd into the cloned directory.
1. Run `$ http-server`
1. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.
1. Click 'allow' if your browser asks for permission to share your location.


## How it works:
Local Weather uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display local conditions
based on your latitude and longitude.
